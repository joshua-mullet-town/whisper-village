## Summary

During their coding session, the developer expressed frustration with an overly verbose output from LLM and sought to improve HUD integration for better visibility of summaries. The agent suggested a simpler prompt format without labels or markdown formatting that would result in concise lines indicating what was asked and done by the user respectively. Additionally, two options were proposed: writing summary outputs directly into a dedicated `.claude/SUMMARY.txt` file specifically designed for HUD display (Option A), or having the existing `LAST_INTERACTION.md` parsed to extract just this section of text (Option B). The agent leaned towards Option A as it was cleaner and easier to style independently, with a concise summary format provided by the developer's request in mind.

<summary>Full User Prompt</summary>

What the fuck? That's so cool. Well, for one, I would like for this whole thing that we're generating to change. Like for one, this iso many details. Like you're showing details. because yeah, it's saying last interaction. but then also shows what the user asks entirely, like we don't need to keep all of that stuff in this display because basically what I'd eventually like to do and I can't figure out what the best solution is here, I have this HUD file here locally. Not file, but program. Basically it's it's making it easier for me to see my plan and state docs. That's its main function. It has other bells and whistles on it, but that's the main thing. And so part of me would like to also be able to see the output of this file here, like the summary of what's going on very concisely. My one concern is that the question is. if I want to control the size of it was a little bit more than a little bit. I won't be able to see enough of it. That's my main concern. Or yeah, I sorry, I won't be able to control independently of the plan and state doc font size, which I may want to do. I don't really know. So all that to say want to do it right now, but I think that's overcomable. so yeah, what would you suggest as a way to implement this so that I can always see what the like basically have a dedicated spot to see the summary generated by this LLM. And I also want us to look at the actual prompt we're sending to the LLM, because I am confident it can get better than what it is right now. Cause it's just too verbose and asking for things I never wanted. Or at least returning things I never wanted.
