USER asked to fix the double-tap send functionality by restoring the original v1.9.0 logic with a 1000ms detection window, then ship the release and investigate GitHub issues.

AGENT restored the double-tap detection to check first at keypress start with early return, shipped v1.9.15, and identified four open issues with #5 (iTerm linking error messages) as the next target.
