USER asked to update Whisper Village's summary hook UI from Ollama to Claude Haiku, then restore the original double-tap send functionality with a 1000ms detection window.
AGENT updated the settings UI text, removed Ollama dependencies, and restored v1.9.0 double-tap logic that checks for double-tap at the start of keypress before any state transitions.
