# Whisper Village Plan - What We're Doing

**Purpose:** Active work queue and future plans. Current task always at top. When completed, scoop off top and consolidate into STATE.md.

---

## CURRENT: Nothing Active

All recent work completed and documented in STATE.md.

---

## NEXT: Spec Browser HUD (`/hud spec`)

**Goal:** Terminal-based navigator for spec-driven projects. Replaces PLAN.md + STATE.md with a visual interface for browsing spec files.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Ink** (React for terminal) - component-based TUI
- Global Claude Code command: `/hud spec`

---

## BACKLOG: Command Mode Phase 2 (Future)

**Ideas explored but deferred:**
- Slack navigation (requires OAuth token per workspace - too complex for now)
- Text commands ("type hello world")
- Complex commands ("open terminal and run npm start")
- Custom user-defined commands

## BACKLOG: Bug - Mic Permanently Stolen from Other Apps

**Problem:** When Whisper Village activates, it permanently kills audio input for other apps (e.g., Teams).

**Fix Applied (testing needed):**
Added `audioEngine = nil` and `inputNode = nil` in `StreamingRecorder.stopRecording()` to fully release mic.

---

## FUTURE: Voice-Activated Start

**Goal:** Start transcription with voice alone (no hotkey needed).

---

## FUTURE: Automated Transcription Testing Framework

**Goal:** Automated accuracy testing with TTS-generated audio to identify weaknesses and track improvements.
